# Welcome to the OpenStack Install Scripts project on GitHub

This project aims to covert the steps in the OpenStack Install guide into useful/simple scripts. The goal is not to provide a complete automation solution. But the idea is to have simple building blocks which can help developers and enthusiasts experiment with OpenStack in a much simpler fashion.
